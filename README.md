## My skills
- Programming languages: C/C++, C#, Python, JavaScript.
- Front-end: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ReactJS.

I am extremely passionate about discovering new things and advanced technologies
To tell you a little, I really like manufacturing and assembly, and I have a dream of being able to contribute a small part to the creation of mobile space. Don't rush to judge this dream of mine, just look, my heart is quite fragile. :(
